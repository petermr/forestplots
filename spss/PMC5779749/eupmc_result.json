    "To evaluate the function of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) treatment to pain relief and life quality for patients with spinal tumors.Articles about the researches on the treatment of spinal tumors by PVP in PubMed, Embase, and the Chinese Biomedical Literature database from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2013. The keywords \"spinal tumors,\" \"efficacy,\" and \"vertebroplasty\" were firstly scanned to exclude all irrelevant articles. Then, the final inclusion of studies was determined by reading the full text of the remaining articles. The citation lists of all retrieved articles were scanned to identify other potentially relevant reports. RevMan5.2 was used to analyze pain intensity visual analog scale (VAS) and Karnofsky performance scores (KPS) within each research. Combined HRs (hazard ratio) were calculated using fixed- or random- effects models according to the heterogeneity.Twenty-six studies involving 1351 patients met our selection criteria. Meta-analysis results among 10 case-control studies showed that the combined HR was -2.83 [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.92, -2.73; P < .0001], indicating a 2.83-fold decrease of pain in PVP group. For 12 single-arm studies, a significantly decrease of pain after PVP treatment (HR = -4.79, 95% CI -5.00, -4.57, P < .0001) was also found in PVP group. In addition, for KPS analysis, the combined HR was 16.31 (95% CI 14.31, 18.31; P < .0001), which indicated that PVP treatment was associated with a 16.31-fold increase of KPS. The combined HR was 0.58 (95% CI 0.35, 0.96; P = .04) for complication analysis.PVP treatment of spinal tumor is significantly associated with better pain relief and life quality, which could improve the outcome in metastatic spinal tumor patients."
