Given the small number of studies and substantial heterogeneity of adverse events, a subgroup analysis was not performed.</p><p>The safety of different dosages of anti-VEGF agent was only investigated in the ocular intolerance and conjunctival adverse event, as the limited studies reported the adverse event in cornea. In our included RCTs, the dosage of anti-VEGF is 5&#x0200a;mg/mL in 2 studies, 12.5&#x0200a;mg/mL in 3 studies, 25&#x0200a;mg/mL in 10 studies, and unclear in the other 3 studies.

The pooled results of the studies suggest that use of an anti-VEGF agent in the ocular anterior segment for patients with pterygium and glaucoma is generally safe.</p><p>This result was consistent with most of the previous reports suggesting that anterior segment anti-VEGF administration is safe. Hu et al found from their meta-analysis that there were no statistically significant differences in the occurrence of complications between the bevacizumab group and the control group of patients with pterygium, but there was a higher risk of subconjunctival hemorrhage. It is found out that anti-VEGF treatment may be risk factor for conjunctival graft ischemic adverse events in our study. Bahar et al conducted a prospective and consecutive study in 10 eyes with corneal neovascularization due to various diseases. These patients received subconjunctival injection of 2.5&#x0200a;mg/0.1&#x0200a;mL bevacizumab for 2 weeks and no adverse events were observed during the follow-up time of 3.5 months. Likewise, Dastjerdi et al found that treatment with topical bevacizumab 10% for 3 weeks in 10 eyes with stable CNV was well tolerated. Most of the adverse events were conjunctival disorders that may due to the injection procedure. Interestingly, the significant difference was not found out in the subgroup based on administration route, but in the subgroup based on the dosage. Subconjunctivally injected bevacizumab more easily to penetrate through an intact epithelium than topically applied bevacizumab.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Though, in experimental studies, it was found to be tolerant on cultured human corneal endothelial cell in doses of bevacizumab up to 5&#x0200a;mg,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> the ideal dosage is still unclear within the limit evidence.</p><p>However, as stated before, it was suggested that the healing process for the epithelial defect was slower in anti-VEGF group after pterygium surgery, even though there was no significant difference.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> There are dozens of rodent studies using anti-VEGF agents for various pathologies, but most of them evaluated anti-VEGF effects on CNV, relevant inflammatory factors, or the timing of treatment, and did not report the adverse events. And there were a few studies that reported that the application of anti-VEGF could hinder the healing process in a corneal epithelial defect model.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> Only 1 RCT using anti-VEGF agents for treating corneal neovascular was reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> And there was the epithelia defect event both in the anti-VEGF group and the control group. Kim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> reported a prospective, consecutive, and interventional case series including 10 eyes with CNV that were treated with 1.25% bevacizumab (twice per day) for 3 months. Surprisingly, the anti-VEGF treatment was stopped in 6 eyes in the second month due to delayed side effects, including epithelial defects, stromal thinning, descemetocele, and epithelial erosion. The initial diagnoses for these 6 eyes were severe acid injury, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and postpenetrating keratoplasty. Koenig et al<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> also found new corneal epithelial defects in 5 eyes (18.5%) after topical bevacizumab treatment (5&#x0200a;mg/mL) for 0.5 to 12 months (5&#x0200a;times/d). These facts suggested that epithelial healing may be postponed in patients with primary corneal epithelial defects, and new corneal epithelial defects may occur after anti-VEGF administration, especially in those with limbal insufficiency. Though our meta-analysis showed no corneal epithelia adverse event was associated with the administration of an anti-VEGF agent, it was likely due to the diverse initial diagnoses, the differing status of the corneal epithelium, and surgical history.</p><p>Until now, there was still insufficient evidence to answer whether anti-VEGF administration in the ocular anterior segment is safe or not because of the selection bias of these 18 RCTs in which the corneas were mostly intact before anti-VEGF treatment. Epithelial growth and differentiation are also dynamically regulated by VEGF via various cytokines.<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> Thus, the repair process may be affected by anti-VEGF treatment in eyes. Bevacizumab is shown to downregulate the expression of nerve growth factor, a polypeptide for promoting corneal epithelium proliferation. Blockade of VEGF could reduce the growth and regeneration of cultured neurons by 17% and 23% in rats.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> However, as conflicting evidence, bevacizumab did not affect the proliferation of cultured human corneal epithelial cells and was even observed to promote corneal epithelial wound healing.</p><p>Among the included studies, only 3 studies reported new corneal defect or ulcer events and the incidence ranged 3% to 8% without a significant difference compared with control group. In another relevant case series, it was pointed out that spontaneous corneal epithelial defects may also be a potential complication of anti-VEGF agent administration to eyes with a history of keratoplasty. Gan et al<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> reported that 4 of 5 eyes developed persistent or recurrent epithelial defects after treatment with an anti-VEGF agent in patients with a history of keratoplasty or limbal transplantation. It was suggested that the adhesiveness of the new corneal epithelium to the underlying extracellular matrix might have been weakened. It was reported that 1.5&#x0200a;mg/mL of bevacizumab could downregulate the expression of surface integrins and collagens in fibroblast cells, and thus delay epithelial closure.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the concentrations of epithelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and tumor necrosis factor increased in patients treated with bevacizumab and thus might increase corneal susceptibility to complications.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup></p><p>Limitations, such as publication bias, should be taken into account when interpreting the results of this meta-analysis. Few studies mentioned ocular symptoms and the absence of relevant questionnaires also limits the ability to draw a definitive conclusion. Most of these studies did not provide complete information for the adverse events, such as the preoperative ocular condition and the timing of the complication. Also, diverse diseases were included in the 18 RCTs. There were a few small-sized studies that reported severe ocular adverse events after anti-VEGF treatment for CNV after keratoplasty. Unfortunately, most of them were case series and could not be included in this meta-analysis. In addition, the meta-analysis was limited by the categorization of the adverse events, as described in the Methods.</p><p>Nevertheless, this meta-analysis showed that the administration of an anti-VEGF agent in the ocular anterior segment for treatment of pterygium and neovascular glaucoma was safe. However, due to the limited evidence, further research should be performed on the safety of different dosage anti-VEGF administration in patients with CNV or keratoplasty. Given the potential risks for corneal epithelial healing in patients with a history of keratoplasty, it is very important to pay more attention to the integrity of the corneal epithelium before administering an anti-VEGF agent into the ocular anterior segment.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to the following people who have helped in various steps of the project: Cong Sun, Tao Zhou, and Yu-gui Zhou.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Shitong Huang, Bi-shan Tian, Ou Xiao.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Shitong Huang, Bi-shan Tian, Yong-Juan Yang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Shitong Huang, Shi-you Zhou.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-97-e11960-s001.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e675" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: anti-VEGF = antivascular endothelial growth factor, CI = confidence intervals, CNV = corneal neovascularization, OR = odds ratios, RCT = randomized controlled trial, VEGF = vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>S-tH and B-sT contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The manuscript has not been presented at any meetings.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Design of study (S-yZ); conduct of study (S-tH); collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of data (S-tH, B-sT, OX); preparation of the manuscript (S-tH, OX, Y-jY); and review and approval of the manuscript (S-yZ).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kwong</surname><given-names>TQ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohamed</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group>
