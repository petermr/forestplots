    "Women diagnosed with breast cancer at young age often have poorprognoses. Yet, few studies have focused on the prognoses of young men with breast cancer. We therefore used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) population-based data and identified 151 male patients with breast cancer aged <40 years between 1988 and 2012. Propensity score matching analysis was used to balance the clinical variables among different groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were applied to compare the survival differences. The subgroup variables on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard model. Results showed that male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had a significant OS benefit compared with those aged ≥40 years (P < .001). The significant difference of the CSS was not found (P > .05). Compared with the male patients with breast cancer aged ≥40, those aged <40 had significant OS benefit in most subgroups (P < .05). Compared with the female patients with breast cancer aged <40, the male patients with breast cancer aged <40 had worse OS and CSS benefit only in the subgroup with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor positive (P < .05). In conclusion, we demonstrated that young male patients with breast cancer had better OS compared with elder male patients with breast cancer. However, the survival benefit was not found compared with young female patients with breast cancer."
