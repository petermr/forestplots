    "BACKGROUND:To give an overview on implant survival rates in patients with oral manifestations of systemic autoimmune (oral Lichen planus (oLp), Pemphigus (Pe)), muco-cutaneous (Epidermolysis bullosa (EB)), autoimmune multisystemic rheumatic diseases (Sjögren's syndrome (SjS), systemic Lupus erythematosus (sLE), or systemic Sclerosis (sSc)). MATERIAL AND METHODS:Systematic literature review (PubMed/Medline, Embase) using MESH and search term combinations, published between 1980 and August 2018 in English language reporting on dental implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with oLp, Pe, EB, SjS, sLE, sSc, study design, age, gender, follow-up period (≥ 12 months), implant survival rate. Implant-related weighed mean values of implant survival rate (wmSR) were calculated. RESULTS:After a mean follow-up period (mfp) of 44.6 months, a wmSR of 98.3 % was calculated from data published for patients with oLp (100 patients with 302 implants). Data of 27 patients (152 implants) with EB revealed wmSR of 98.7 % following mfp of 32.6 months. For 71 patients (272 implants) with SjS, wmSR was 94.2 % following a mfp of 45.2 months, and for 6 patients (44 implants) with sSc, wmSR was 97.7 % after mfp of 37.5 months. One case report on one patient each with Pe (two implants) as well as sLE (6 implants) showed 100 % SR following at least 24 months. CONCLUSIONS:Guidelines regarding implant treatment of patients with oLp, Pe, EB, SjS, sLE or sSc do not exist nor are contraindicating conditions defined. Implant survival rates of patients affected are comparable to those of healthy patients. For implant-prosthetic rehabilitation of patients with Pe and sLE no conclusions can be drawn due to lack of sufficient clinical data. Implant-prosthetic treatment guidelines regarding healthy patients should be strictly followed, but frequent recall is recommended in patients affected with oLp, SjS, EB, SSc, Pe or sLE."
