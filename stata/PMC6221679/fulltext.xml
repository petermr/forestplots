In addition, elemene was mainly compared with DDP in limited number of clinical trials.

Results from the sub-group analysis showed that there was significant difference in the incidence of gastrointestinal reactions between the 2 groups in lung cancer patients [OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.56, 95% CI (0.43&#x02013;0.75)].</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Forest plot of comparison: elemene versus other medications, outcome: gastrointestinal adverse reactions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e12542-g011"/></fig></sec><sec><label>3.4.5</label><title>Publication bias assessment</title><p>The data of efficacy was used to detect the publication bias.

As illustrated by the funnel plot, the figure is basically symmetrical, suggesting no significant risk of bias (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;.05) and indicating that the meta-analysis results are stable and reliable (Supplemental Figure 3).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Elemene has been widely used in the treatment of cancer, including complications of cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]</sup> In recent years, several publications supporting elemene in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion have been reported, but their findings are established based on limited number of patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In this meta-analysis, we found that elemene could significantly improve the short-term control of malignant pleural effusion. Subgroup results showed that the effective rate of elemene in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion was significantly higher than that of the DDP group. Meanwhile, elemene did not significantly increase the incidence of adverse events.</p><p>Meta-analysis results of this study showed that, elemene alone or combined with DDP or BLM could improve the CR rate [OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.55, 95% CI (1.34, 1.79)] when compared with DDP, BLM. Subgroup analysis showed that elemene combined with DDP or BLM or hyperthermia could improve complete control of the pleural effusion in lung cancer patients [OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.67, 95% CI (1.28, 2.17)]. In term of QOL improvement, elemene alone or combined with DDP or BLM could improve QOL [OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.58, 95% CI (1.29, 1.93)]. Subgroup analysis showed that this beneficial effectiveness existed in both lung cancer and other malignant tumors.</p><p>A few meta-analyses<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> have been published to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elemene in treating various types of tumors, including lung cancer. Xu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]</sup> performed a study to assess the efficacy of elemene in cancer treatment. A total of 11 trials were included after their search of several databases. The results showed that elemene combined with chemotherapy had a significant rise in the number of patients who achieved treatment response, associated with low risk of adverse events. However, their findings failed to prove elemene was better in improving survival rate. Another study by Chen et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> evaluated the clinical efficacy of elemene in treating lung cancer patients with malignant pleural effusion. They included a total of 14 RCTs with 1298 cancer patients for the meta-analysis and the results showed that the objective response rate of the elemene was significantly higher than that of the control group, especially when compared with DDP. Recently, Wang et al<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> performed another meta-analysis to assess the clinical efficacy of elemene versus DDP in treating malignant pleural effusion caused by lung cancer. They included 14 studies with a total of 732 lung cancer patients. Their findings suggested that the ORR in elemene group was significantly higher than that of the DDP group. These results are in accordance with our findings. Our results showed that elemene was not only exhibiting the ability of controlling malignant pleural effusion, but also improving QOL with tolerable adverse events. With regard to adverse reactions, we also found that the incidences of chest pain and fever in elemene group were increased when compared with control group, but the rates of myelo-suppression and gastrointestinal reaction were similar or even decreased when compared with other medications. These may be caused by the varied types of cancer, different combination of treatment and other aspects. The subgroup analyses showed that elemene was most effective in treating pleural effusion caused by lung cancer.</p><p>Though the results of our meta-analysis show beneficial clinical outcomes and safety when using elemene for cancer patients with malignant pleural effusion, several limitations exist in our study. First, the overall qualities of the included studies are moderate, with moderate risk of bias. Though most of the included studies are RCTs, few of them reported details of randomization, blinding, indicating potential selection and detection bias may exist. Besides, the number of sample varies across studies. Second, though there is no significant heterogeneity across these eligible studies, the characteristics of patients and study design are different. All the included studies did not report the overall survival rate, making the total survival of patients with malignant pleural effusion still inconclusive. These inherent differences may increase the risk of bias. Overall, the findings of our meta-analysis are reliable, but it should be carefully viewed.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study show that elemene treatment can improve clinical control of malignant pleural effusion, QOL, with tolerable adverse events. Large scale, randomized, controlled, clinical trials are required to verify our findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Dong-sheng Zhou.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Dong-sheng Zhou.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Ze-lin Zhang, Jian Liang.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Qing-tao Wang, Ze-lin Zhang.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> Jun Li.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Jian Liang.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Jun Li.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Hui Xiong.</p><p><bold>Validation:</bold> Ya-fei Wang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Qing-tao Wang, Jian Liang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Ze-lin Zhang.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental Digital Content</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="medi-97-e12542-s001.doc" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e801" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BLM = bleomycin, CBM = Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, CCTs = clinical controlled trials, CI = confidence interval, CR = complete response, DDP = cisplatin, OR = odds ratio, ORR = overall response rate, PR = partial response, QOL = quality of life, RCTs = randomized controlled trials, RR = risk ratio.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>QW and ZZ contribute equally.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supplemental Digital Content is available for this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Porcel</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Sole</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Salud</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
