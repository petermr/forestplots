    "BACKGROUND:Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a potentially severe adverse drug reaction especially in susceptible patients. But there are no sensitive or specific parameters to detecting DILI. The specific expression of miR-122 in the liver has been a hotspot in the evaluation of hepatic toxicity due to its high stability and sensitivity. METHODS:We performed a systematic literature review through July 31, 2017 to identify studies which evolved DILI patients testing miR-122 without limiting a certain drug. According to the PRISMA statement, a meta-analysis: the diagnostic role of miR-122 in DILI was made. QUADAS-2 quality evaluation table was used to evaluate the quality of the documentary evidence, PRISMA flowchart and quality evaluation table were drawn with RevMan, use Stata to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of miR-122 in diagnosing DILI, ROC curve and Deeks funnel plot were also drawn by STATA. RESULTS:Eleven studies involved 194 DILI patients and 251 controls, all were tested miR-122 (fold change). Sensitivity of miR-122 in diagnosing DILI was [0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.91), I = 53.46%] and specificity was [0.93 (95% CI, 0.86-0.97), I = 65.10%], the area under ROC curve was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). While in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury, the sensitivity was [0.82 (95%CI, 0.67-0.91), I = 65.77%] specificity was [0.96 (95%CI, 0.88-0.99), I = 31.46%], AUROC was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.98). CONCLUSIONS:In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found miR-122 have a high specificity in DILI, and a modest positive diagnostic effects. On the basis of the limited evidence, further research is needed to evaluate the long-term observation and more clinical data to testify miR-122 in diagnosing DILI."
