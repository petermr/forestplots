However, the prognosis remains unsatisfactory due to the recurrence and metastasis, with 5-year and 10-year survival rate of approximately 80% and 60%.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Also, there are several patients who are not reluctant to undergo surgical resection in clinic.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Therefore, it is essential to stratify the patients preoperatively and then the surgery is only strongly recommended for the patients with excellent prognostic outcomes.</p><p>Current studies have reported tumor size, pathologic tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging, Ki67 expression, receptor status (estrogen receptor, ER; progesterone receptor, PR; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HER2) and molecular subtypes (lumina-type, HER2-positive, and triple-negative) are significantly associated with the prognosis of patients with BC.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, most of these factors are usually obtained under the requirement of core biopsies and with the aid of molecular technique, which is invasive and costly. Their prognostic accuracy is also reported to be unsatisfactory, with the example of the different TNM stage or molecular subtypes having the same prognoses.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Thus, more easily available and efficient preoperative prognostic parameters are desirable to guide individualized treatment.</p><p>Emerging evidence has demonstrated inflammation exerts important roles in the development and progression of cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Moreover, blood-based tests for inflammatory factors are easy to perform, less expensive, and readily available. Thus, a serial of inflammatory immune cells (i.e., neutrophil, lymphocyte, white cells) and cytokines (i.e., C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) have been suggested as underlying prognostic biomarkers.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Of them, the ratio of absolute neutrophil count to absolute lymphocyte count (NLR) is the most commonly investigated indicator for assessment of the inflammatory status in patients with cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> A higher preoperative NLR is reported to be associated with poor survival in patients with BC.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> However, some studies failed to find the correlation between the preoperative NLR and the overall survival (OS) of patients with BC.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, in some clinical trials, only white cell and neutrophil counts are routinely detected and thus the derived NLR (dNLR) [defined as absolute neutrophil count divided by the derived lymphocyte count (absolute leukocyte count&#x02013;neutrophil count)] was also used for NLR alternative. Also, it remains controversial on the prognostic role of dNLR for BC.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Hereby, the goal of this study was to further evaluate the prognostic potential of preoperative NLR and dNLR for BC patients using a meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Search strategy</title><p>A systematic literature search was carried out independently by 2 investigators in PubMed and Cochrane Library databases for screening studies published to September 2018 that assessed the relationship between preoperative NLR and the prognosis of patients with BC.

However, the meta-analysis for integrative assessment of the prognostic value of dNLR with controversial literatures<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> had not been reported previously. In this study, we, for the first time, included 3 articles of BC and proved high-preoperative dNLR was also significantly associated with worse OS and DFS in patients with BC.</p><p>An elevated NLR/dNLR indicated the neutrophil-dependent inflammatory reaction was increased, but lymphocyte-mediated antitumor immune response was lower. There have evidence to demonstrate tumor associated neutrophils support metastatic initiation of BC.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Neutrophil-derived leukotrienes aided the colonization of distant tissues by selectively expanding the subpool of cancer cells that retain high tumorigenic potential. Inhibition of the leukotriene-generating enzyme arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase may abrogate pro-metastatic activity of neutrophils and reduce lung metastasis.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Anticancer drugs (i.e., 5-fluorouracil) mediated aggravation of BC metastasis to lung was also attributed to increased intrapulmonary neutrophil numbers and expression of neutrophilic chemokines (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2) in tumor cells. The administration of a neutrophil-depleting antibody or a C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 (Cxcr2) antagonist, SB225002, significantly attenuated 5-fluorouracil-mediated enhanced lung metastasis.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> Donati et al<sup>[<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]</sup> also reported neutrophils may promote adhesiveness, invasiveness, and migration of BC cells by secreting cytokine interleukin-16, while instillation of an interleukin-16 neutralizing antibody reversed the effects of neutrophils. Even, Coffelt et al<sup>[<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]</sup> found tumor-induced neutrophils may promote the establishment of pulmonary and lymph node metastases by suppressing cytotoxic T lymphocytes. BC patients with metastases are more prone to have shorter survival time. In line with these studies, we also found the HR of NLR for poor OS was higher in studies with mixed stage (having metastatic cases) than the early stage.</p><p>There are several limitations in this meta-analysis. Firstly, all of enrolled studies were retrospective, which may lead to some biases. Secondly, only 3 studies were included to evaluate the prognostic significance of dNLR for survival, which may lead to the overestimation or underestimation of its value. Thirdly, most of studies included neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment protocols and the survival outcomes may be influenced. Fourthly, the cut-off value for the NLR differed in each study although it was both significant according to our subgroup analysis. This may influence their clinical application.</p><p>In conclusion, this meta-analysis demonstrates preoperative NLR/dNLR may be effective predictive biomarkers for prognosis in patients with BC. Detection of NLR/dNLR may be helpful to identify the patients who benefit from the surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>JWD and MY participated in conception and design of this study.
