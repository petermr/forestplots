    "Retinoblastoma (Rb) is the most common intra-ocular malignancy in children. The association of rs2279744, and rs937283 in MDM2 gene, and p21 rs1801270 polymorphism and RB development have been demonstrated. To provide a comprehensive assessment of and to clarify associations between the 3 SNPs (MDM2 rs2279744, MDM2 rs937283, and p21 rs1801270) and the risk of RB, we performed a meta-analysis of all the eligible case-control studies. We searched English databases include PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library, using an upper date limit of January 1, 2018. The association between MDM2 rs2279744, MDM2 rs937283, and p21 rs1801270 polymorphisms and the risk of RB were estimated by calculating a pooled OR and 95% CI under a homozygote comparison, heterozygote comparison, dominant model, and recessive model. The statistical power analysis was performed using G*Power. Our meta-analysis showed a significant association between RB susceptibility and MDM2 rs2279744 recessive model (OR = 1.427, 95%CI: 1.107-1.840, P = .006, I = 0%). Moreover, a significant link was observed between RB risk and MDM2 rs937283 homozygote comparison (OR = 0.471, 95%CI: 0.259-0.858, P = .014, I = 0%) and recessive model (OR = 0.587, 95%CI: 0.410-0.840, P = .004, I = 0%). However, no significant relationship between the p21 rs1801270 polymorphism and RB susceptibility was detected in any of the 4 models (P > .05). In conclusion, we found that significant association between the MDM2 rs2279744 polymorphism and increased RB risk, while MDM2 rs937283 polymorphism was associated with significantly decreased RB risk. However, as to the P21 rs1801270 polymorphism, a statistically significant association was not identified for RB."
