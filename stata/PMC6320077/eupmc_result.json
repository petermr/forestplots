    "BACKGROUND:Risedronate is widely used in the therapy of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone diseases. This meta-analysis was aimed to assess whether administration risedronate could increase the bone mineral density (BMD) in patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). METHODS:Electronic databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese Wanfang database were searched for all relevant studies. Inclusion criterion was that patients prepared for THA and use risedronate as intervention group and placebo as control group. BMD change in Gruen zone 1 and 7 were primary outcomes. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12.0 software. RESULTS:Six RCTs were finally included in this meta-analysis. Compared with control group, risedronate has a beneficial role in increasing BMD in Gruzen 1, 2 6, and 7 at 3 months (P < .05). Oral risedronate has a beneficial role in preservation of BMD in all of the Gruen zones at 6 and 12 months (P < .05). Moreover, oral risedronate could significantly increase the Harris hip scores and bone alkaline phosphatase than control group (P < .05). CONCLUSION:Oral risedronate has an effect on the preservation of periprosthetic BMD in proximal regions (Gruen zone 1, 2, 3, and 7) at 3 months and all of the regions at 6 and 12 months after THA."
