Although a number of studies have demonstrated that the FIB-4 index was a useful marker for predicting liver fibrosis, the relationships between this serum index and the outcomes in HCC patients remain obscure. Hence, we conducted the current analyses.</p><p>In this meta-analysis, we identified 8 articles with 3485 HCC patients as qualified for pooled analysis. The combined results showed that FIB-4 score was significantly associated with OS and RFS in HCC. Furthermore, the high FIB-4 score could be an independent poor factor of OS and RFS in HCC patients. The subgroup analyses also confirmed the prognostic significance of FIB-4 in HCC patients. High FIB-4 in HCC patients indicated poorer survival outcomes. The FIB-4 score could serve as a noninvasive predictive marker for HCC cancer prognosis.</p><p>The FIB-4 index is a fibrosis-related index containing 4 common factors: age, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), platelet count and alanine transaminase (ALT).<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> As mentioned above, the finding of our study was that the FIB-4 index could serve as a promising prognostic factor for both OS and RFS in HCC patients. However, the exact mechanisms of prognostic roles of FIB-4 index in HCC remain unclear. OS usually depends on the factors related to liver function and tumor-related factors, while RFS was decided by tumor-related factors.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The FIB-4 index was previously identified as a liver fibrosis index that could reflect the degree of liver fibrosis, and most of HCC patients were accompanied by different degrees of liver fibrosis, which affected the normal functions and liver reserve and lead to poor survival. In addition, some studies have shown that liver fibrosis and the FIB-4 index were related to hepatocarcinogenesis,<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> the FIB-4 index could be a risk factor that was associated with the survival and recurrence after hepatectomy. Furthermore, AST and ALT could reflect the degree of liver disorder, and the platelet count could reflect the patient's portal hypertension status<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> and a low platelet count level was demonstrated to be an unfavorable factor in HCC.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Moreover, patient age was also found to be a significant prognostic factor in a nationwide follow-up survey in HCC patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup></p><p>The present meta-analysis included several limitations. Firstly, all included studies were retrospective observational studies. Secondly, the total sample size enrolled in our study was relatively small. In addition, all HCC cases enrolled were from Asian countries, including China, Japan, and Korea, further studies from other countries with more ethnic groups are necessary. Furthermore, studies with negative results are generally less likely to be published than ones with positive results, this might cause selection bias. And there were some other variables that could also affect the HCC patient survival, such as post-hepatectomy chemotherapy, tumor size, and tumor differentiation. Finally, the cutoff value for high FIB-4 index varied in different studies, it was essential to be unified before it could be applied in clinical management.</p><p>In summary, our data suggest that liver fibrosis index FIB-4 could predict the clinical outcomes in HCC patients. The FIB-4 score might be helpful as a promising prognostic candidate to monitor HCC patients&#x02019; survival and recurrence after treatment. Multi-center prospective clinical studies with a larger sample are required to validate our results.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Yi Zhang, Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Rong Wang, Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Yi Zhang, Rong Wang.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Yi Zhang, Rong Wang, Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Yi Zhang, Rong Wang, Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Project administration:</bold> Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Yi Zhang, Rong Wang.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Yi Zhang, Rong Wang, Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Yi Zhang, Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Validation:</bold> Yi Zhang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Yi Zhang, Xianjin Yang.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Yi Zhang, Xianjin Yang.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: 95% CIs = 95% confidence intervals, ALT = alanine transaminase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, DFS = disease-free survival, HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma, HRs = hazard ratios, NOS = Newcastle&#x02013;Ottawa scale, OS = overall survival, RFS = recurrence-free survival.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Torre</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Siegel</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
