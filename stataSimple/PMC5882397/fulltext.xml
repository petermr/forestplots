Therefore, early detection was very important to the treatments of oral cancer, and therefore reduced the mortality rates of mouth cancer. It was commonly believed that environmental factors such as drinking, smoking, chewing betel nuts, and ultraviolet radiation modulated multistep process of oral carcinogenesis. Furthermore, some other intrinsic factors such as genetic and epigenetic alternations were also involved in the multistep carcinogenesis of oral cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> In recent years, DNA hypomethylation, DNA hypermethylation, loss of imprinting, chromosome inactivation, histone acetylation, histone deacetylation, histone methylation, and microRNA changes were referred in the studies of oral cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Meanwhile, these studies often focused on gene methylation which regulated the gene expression without DNA sequence changes. And promoter methylation of many tumor suppressor genes were reported in several cancers like breast cancer, thyroid cancer, liver cancer, and nonsmall cell lung cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> In previous studies, promoter aberrant methylation of many candidate genes, including <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>p15</italic>, <italic>p14</italic>, <italic>DAPK</italic>, <italic>p73</italic>, <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>WIF1</italic>, <italic>RUNX3</italic>, <italic>MGMT</italic>, and <italic>hMLH1</italic>, have been identified in oral cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that the incidence rate of aberrant methylation of these genes in oral cancer tissues were higher than the normal tissues. For example, Don et al<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> have performed a systematic meta-analysis and observed a higher prevalence of methylation of <italic>p16</italic>, <italic>DAPK,</italic> and <italic>MGMT</italic> in OSCC. At the same time, many other case&#x02013;control or cohort studies have been conducted to explore the potential role of these tumor suppressor genes in the process of oral cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> The results suggested that these genes were often significantly associated with the invasion, metastasis, and differentiation of oral tumor. Thus, these tumor suppressor genes that occurred aberrant methylation might be good biomarkers for the early detection and early treatment of oral cancer.</p><p>RASSF1A (RAS association domain family protein 1a), a kind of ras association family (RASSF) proteins, was involved in the Ras/PI3K/AKT signal pathways. RASSF1A played a key role in the cell cycle control, microtubule stabilization, cellular adhesion and motility as well as apoptosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Moreover, several studies have also found <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation contributed a lot to the gene silencing, and therefore leaded to the tumor occurrence.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Based on the previous record, the promoter hypermethylation of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> was a common phenomenon in many various tumors.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> The hypermethylation of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter region was originally detected in lung cancer and breast cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Since then, hypermethylation of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> gene was reported in many different cancers and was described as a good prognostic indicator.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Several studies have also been performed to evaluate the relationship between <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation and oral cancer risk. However, the results remained inconsistent. Moreover, the results of other studies indicated that <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic> promoter hypermethylation frequencies were very high in oral cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Therefore, in order to systematic assess the associations of <italic>RASSF1A</italic>, <italic>CDH1</italic>, and <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic> promoter hypermethylation with oral cancer risk, we conducted this meta-analysis.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Search strategy for included studies</title><p>In this study, 2 researchers independently retrieved PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure) databases and included the relevant articles.

On the basis of the results, the overall pooled ORs clarified that <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with oral cancer risk (OR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11.8, 95% CI&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6.14&#x02013;22.66).

These changes affected the normal growth control of cells in which cell cycle was disturbed and cell abnormal proliferation was driven. Although several changes of chromosome and genes were described in OSCC, the fundamental cause was the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.<sup>[<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]</sup> For example, one of the most important tumor suppressor genes was p16, as we all known, it regulated the cell growth just like p53.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Much of the work of genetic and epigenetic changes in oral cancer have been done, however, complex interactions between the gene products and signal pathways were very complicated.<sup>[<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</sup> MDM (murine double minute), class of oncogenes, had a multiple role in tumor inhibition, in which MDM2 (murine double minute 2) inhibited p53 if p53 mutations were absent. Moreover, the tumor cell cycle was regulated by p16 and p14 which stabilized p53 protein by MDM2.<sup>[<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]</sup> Although a lot of studies about tumor suppressor genes in OSCC were conducted, there might be some different patterns of gene silencing among oral cancer patients. Therefore, more tumor suppressor genes might be studied to discuss the potential role in the development of oral cancer.</p><p>According to the results of literature search, this was the first meta-analysis to evaluate the associations of <italic>RASSF1A</italic>, <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic>, and <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter hypermethylation with oral cancer risk. In the present study, 12 studies were combined to assess the association between <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation and oral cancer risk, in which the results indicated a significant association. In the included studies, these results were consistent with the results of Su et al, Zhang et al, Williams et al, and Durr et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> At the same time, no significant heterogeneity among studies was detected in which <italic>P</italic> value was &#x0003e; .05 and <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> value was &#x0003c; 50%. So although oral cancer included many subtypes, theses studies could be put together to calculate the pooled ORs and assess the association between levels of genes methylation and oral cancer risk. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis was still conducted to obtain more accurate results in different races. From the results, we found that <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with oral cancer risk in Asians and Caucasians. However, the number of studies was very small after subgroup analysis based on oral cancer subtype was performed. In addition, the significant correlation between <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation and oral cancer risk was observed both in normal tissue and adjacent tissue of control group. But the results should be carefully taken into consideration due to the small sample size. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic> and <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter hypermethylation were significantly associated with the oral cancer risk. In previous studies, Williams et al and Durr et al believed that there were no association between <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic> methylation and oral cancer risk, however, according to the results of the meta-analysis, the frequency of <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic> promoter hypermethylation in oral cancer group was higher than control group.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> In addition, we discussed the relationship between <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation and clinicopathological features in oral cancer patients. To achieved accurate statistic data, we conducted heterogeneity analysis for all clinicopathological variables of oral cancer and environmental factors such as: smoking and drinking. Significant interstudy heterogeneity was only detected among studies for differentiation of oral cancer (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;73.5%, <italic>P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.</italic>023), and random effects model was therefore applied to calculate the pooled ORs and 95% CI. Based on the ORs and 95% CI derived from the present meta-analysis, a significantly increased risk of tongue cancer with <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation was found. However, no significant associations were found between <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation and tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, differentiation, and TNM-stage of oral cancer. Although there was no clear evidence of significant associations between <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation and clinicopathologic features of oral cancer, we still needed to explore these associations due to the small sample size. Furthermore, more larger scale, multicenter, and more reasonable study should be performed to confirm the predictive value of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation in the development of oral cancer.</p><p>Additionally, significant heterogeneity among studies was detected in the meta-analysis for <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter hypermethylation. Thus, the subgroup analysis based on ethnicity and meta-regression was carried out. The effects of publication year, country, disease type, control type, detection method of methylation, and ethnicity on the association between RASSF1A promoter methylation and oral cancer risk were evaluated by meta-regression. The results showed these factors were not the mainly cause of significant heterogeneity other than ethnicity in which <italic>P</italic> value was &#x0003c; .05. The same results were found in the stratified analysis based on race which no significant heterogeneity was detected in the subgroup analysis. Finally, the pooled ORs of <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic> were stable on the basis of the results of sensitivity analysis. However, significant publication bias for the meta-analysis of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation was detected according to the results of Egger's test (<italic>P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.</italic>006 &#x0003c; .05), while sensitivity analysis results of <italic>RASSF1A</italic> promoter hypermethylation indicated that the ORs were significantly changed after the study of Supic et al<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> was removed. So the study of Supic et al was eliminated and the heterogeneity and publication bias were significantly reduced.</p><p>Notably, although many studies were included to explore these associations, several limitations should be noted in this meta-analysis: the studied population only included Asians and Caucasians; all eligible studies in this meta-analysis were retrospective, some biases might exist in the selection of samples; the cut-off value or evaluation criteria of genes methylation detection was unclear which might bring heterogeneity among different studies; the clinical information of oral patients was too small to get more accurate results; few negative and unpublished studies were included and a tendency for positive results might increase the publication bias.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our meta-analysis demonstrated that <italic>PASSF1A</italic>, <italic>RAR&#x003b2;</italic>, and <italic>CDH1</italic> promoter hypermethylation were significantly associated with the oral cancer risk.
