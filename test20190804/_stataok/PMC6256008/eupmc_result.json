    "AIMS:The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential association between N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2) polymorphisms and drug-induced liver injury during anti-TB treatment (AT-DILI). METHODS:We conducted a systematic review and performed a meta-analysis to clarify the role of NAT2 polymorphism in AT-DILI. PubMed, Medline and EMBASE databases were searched for studies published in English to December 31, 2017, on the association between the NAT2 polymorphism and AT-DILI risk. Outcomes were pooled with random-effects meta-analysis. Details were registered in the PROSPERO register (number: CRD42016051722). RESULTS:Thirty-seven studies involving 1527 cases and 7184 controls were included in this meta-analysis. The overall odds ratio (OR) of AT-DILI associated with NAT2 slow acetylator phenotype was 3.15 (95% CI 2.58-3.84, I2  = 51.3%, P = 0.000). The OR varied between different ethnic populations, ranging from 6.42 (95% CI 2.41-17.10, I2  = 2.3%) for the West Asian population to 2.32 (95% CI 0.58-9.24, I2  = 80.3%) for the European population. Within the slow NAT2 genotype, variation was also observed; NAT2*6/*7 was associated with the highest risk of AT-DILI (OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.09-2.59) compared to the other slow NAT2 acetylators combined. CONCLUSIONS:NAT2 slow acetylation was observed to increase the risk of AT-DILI in tuberculosis patients. Our results support the hypothesis that the slow NAT2 genotype is a risk factor for AT-DILI."
