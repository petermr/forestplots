It usually affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) and transmitted when people who are sick with pulmonary TB expel bacteria into the air, but can also affect other sites (extra pulmonary TB) [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>TB is a global public health problem; approximately one third of the world population is infected by Tubercle bacilli and at risk of developing active disease [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In 2016, globally there were an estimated 10&#x000b7;4 million new cases of tuberculosis, and 600&#x02008;000 new cases with resistance to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/rifampicin">Rifampicin</ext-link> (the most powerful first-line drug) [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Ninety percent of total TB cases and deaths occur in the developing world. Among those, 75% of cases are in the most economically productive age group [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO) TB control report, among the world&#x02019;s 22 high-burden TB countries, Ethiopia ranks seventh [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Agreeing to the ministry of health, TB is the second cause of death after malaria, the third cause of hospital admissions and a main reason of morbidity in Ethiopia. The expected TB incidence in Ethiopia was 261/100,000 inhabitants in 2011. In Ethiopia, almost 50&#x02013;60% of people living with HIV and 10% HIV-negative people have life-time risk of developing TB [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Worldwide, the implementation of Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) has been related to decreased rate of treatment failure, relapse and drug resistance. However, its influence on decreasing TB incidence has been inadequate by non-compliance to DOT, which happens when patients do not turn up for treatment at health facility or community DOT points [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. According to the WHO&#x02019;s report on worldwide plan to halt TB, poor treatment has been caused by evolution of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> strains that do not respond to treatment with standard first line combination of anti-TB medicines, resulting in the emergence of multi drug resistance TB (MDR-TB) in almost every country of the world [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. One of the overarching dilemmas and challenges facing most TB program&#x02019;s is a patient that does not complete TB treatment for one reason or another [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>There is an unfavorable magnitude of poor adherence to treatment of chronic diseases including TB in the world [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, greater than 90% of patients with TB are expected to adhere the treatment in order to facilitate cure. Poor adherence to treatment results failure of cure which increases the risk of development of drug resistant strains, spread of TB in the community and this in turn increases morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Although many national and international efforts have been implemented against TB prevention and control, still patients are failing to complete their treatment to declare cure even with execution of globally recommended strategy (DOT) in almost all parts of the WHO regions [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. According to the current WHO report, throughout the world, significant TB patients have not recovered after several treatments. Some of obstacles are defaulting from treatment, relapsing after completion of the treatment and developing MDR-TB among retreatment cases [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In developing countries, particularly, there are many factors affecting adherence to TB treatment as evidenced from a variety of literatures. Age, lack of treatment support from family, extreme illness, far distance, lack of access to formal health services, traditional beliefs leading to self-treatment, low income, lack of social support, drug side effects, pill burden, lack of food, stigma with lack of disclosure, and lack of adequate communication with health professionals were some of the documented factors [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In Ethiopia, different studies have been conducted to determine the prevalence and determinants of non-adherence to TB medications [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Those studies reported that the prevalence of non-adherence among TB patients ranging from 8.4% to 55.8%. This is higher than the WHO recommendation of less than 10% [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Variable and inconsistent prevalence and determinants of non-adherence were observed in the reported studies. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of non-adherence to TB treatment and its determinants in Ethiopia.

A patient belonging to either intensive or continuation phase under new or retreatment regimen who missed &#x02265;10% of the total prescribed dose was considered as non-adherent. For sputum follow up, patients who missed one and more sputum tests were considered as non-adherent. The primary outcome of this study was the prevalence of non-adherence to TB treatment. The prevalence was calculated by dividing the number of TB patients who did not adhere by the total number of study subjects multiplied by 100. The second outcome considered in this systematic review and meta-analysis was a risk factor that is associated with non-adherence to TB treatment. For the analysis of the risk factors, we considered and collected risk factors which were mentioned in two or more studies by looking at the two by two tables of the factors reported in each study. E-mails were sent to the corresponding or first authors of the studies or abstracts for missing information and a waiting time of 3&#x02013;4 weeks were taken for the responses. If there were no responses, we excluded the study or the parameter that was not available.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical methods, publication bias, heterogeneity and analysis</title><p>The necessary information from each original study was extracted by using a format prepared in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Then, the data were transferred into STATA/se version-14 statistical software for further analyses. For studies which did not present it, a standard error (SE), was calculated using the formula: SE = &#x0221a;p x (1-p)/n in Microsoft excel. The calculated standard error and prevalence rate of each study was then entered into STATA/se version-14 software to calculate the overall prevalence and its 95% CI.</p><p>Publication bias and heterogeneity were also assessed. To check publication bias, a funnel plot, Egger&#x02019;s and Begg&#x02019;s tests at 5% significant level were performed. The distribution of studies and a p-value &#x0003c;0.05 were used to declare publication bias. The heterogeneity of studies was checked using Cochran&#x02019;s Q test (P &#x0003c; 0.10 indicated statistically significant heterogeneity) and I<sup>2</sup> test statistics (which shows the amount of heterogeneity between studies). A naive categorization of values for <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> would not be appropriate for all circumstances, although we would tentatively assign adjectives of low, moderate, and high to <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> values of 25%, 50%, and 75% respectively [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

To minimize the random variations between the point estimates of the primary study, subgroup analysis was carried out based on the geographical settings (regions). In addition, to identify the possible source of heterogeneity, univariate meta regression was performed by considering the sample size of each study. Furthermore, point prevalence with 95% CIs were presented in forest plot. In this plot, the size of each box indicates the weight of the study, while each crossed line refers to 95% CI.

A total of 13 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The study assessed the prevalence of anti TB drug non-adherence and its determinants among TB patients attending Ethiopian health institutions.</p><p>Frequently used definition of non-adherence is a patient who had missed 10% or more of the total prescribed doses of TB drugs, even if it is recommended that every TB patient should adhere to anti-TB medication by following the DOTS strategy [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Non-adherence to anti-TB treatment might lead to an increased risk of drug resistance and a prolonged infectiousness, in addition to relapse and death. Thus, data obtained from this review is essential for planning, implementing and evaluating advocacy, communication and social mobilization work [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>The finding from this study showed that 21.29% of TB patients did not adhere to anti TB drugs. Regional variation in non-adherence to anti TB medication was observed, the highest prevalence of non-adherence (18.25%) was reported in Southern Nations and Nationalities of Ethiopia, 23.61% followed by Tigray region with a prevalence of 22.87% and the least was in Amhara studies 10.0%. This can be plausibly explained by the fact that though life in Amhara farming society is hard, many Amhara&#x02019;s took medication appropriately since they do not want to look ill in front of their families and friends for their better survival. Moreover, resource-limited settings present unique challenges to Anti TB medication adherence. A multitude of structural barriers prevent access to health care and the regular supply of anti-TB drugs. These include the cost of medical care, drugs, and the difficulty of making follow-up appointments due to long distances, family responsibilities and the prohibitive cost of transportation across regions.</p><p>This finding is lower compared to the finding from studies conducted in Tertiary health institution in South East Nigeria, in Sub-Saharan Africa and in South Ethiopia where non-adherence to anti TB drug was reported to be 24.2%, 40% and 24.5% respectively [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, these rates are higher than the WHO recommendation of less than 10% [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This dissimilarity might be due to socio-cultural differences, variability in TB patient risk factor distribution, and the difference in health service accessibility.</p><p>Random effects model was used in our systematic review and meta-analysis, bearing in mind the chances of substantial heterogeneity between studies which were confirmed with the Q test. The pooled prevalence of subgroup analysis revealed clear differences on the prevalence of non-adherence among the regions: Southern Nations and Nationalities of Ethiopia studies reported high prevalence of non-adherence to anti TB treatment followed by Tigray region studies. This discrepancy might be due to the methodological, socio demographic and economic differences between the regions.</p><p>It is important to remind that participants were evaluated through self-reported records that measured non-adherence to TB treatment, rather than gold-standard diagnostic clinical interviews in inferring the results of this systematic review and meta-analysis. In addition, even if each self-report measures of non-adherence to TB treatment have limitations, there is indication that among TB patients the lack of anonymity in formal screening assessments may compromise precise assessment of sensitive personal information.

Most of the factors associated with treatment non-adherence are those related to physical access to health-care services: distance from home to treatment center, employment status, rural residence and a need to use public transport for ambulatory care. In other settings, risk factors such as knowledge about anti TB treatment duration, educational status, poor patient&#x02013;health provider communication, and medication side effects were reported to have been associated with anti TB treatment non-adherence. This is may be due to less understanding about the disease relapse, resistance and treatment failure in less educated patients. Currently, in Ethiopia, TB treatment is being provided freely at the community, grass root level. However, some patients still questioned the accessibility of TB related services.</p><p>Similarly, study conducted in India and Namibia reported that the non-adherence to TB treatment was significantly higher among those who were less educated, unskilled worker, low family income and lower-class family. This may be due to less understanding about the disease relapse, resistance and treatment failure in less educated patients [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, forgetfulness showed a significant association with non-adherence to TB treatment. An increment in the overall patient forgetfulness has a positive effect on patient non-adherence to TB treatment. This is consistent with the previous studies in different regions of Ethiopia [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This problem may be related to older age which is related with encephalopathy or dementia. From this study long waiting time in health institutions and feeling distance to health institution is long were the main reasons for non-adherence as in line with study done in Peru and Russia in which distance was the main reason for non-adherence followed by feeling better and lack of family support [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. TB treatment is provided as per DOT principle in Ethiopia, which is difficult for patients to collect their medication every day from the clinics [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This suggests that distance from the clinic might be the main barrier for adherence in TB patients. as reported from a study in Southern Ethiopia, side effects of the drugs is also an important reason for anti TB drug non-adherence among TB patients [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Whilst the likelihood of not adhering to anti TB drugs among TB patients with side effects of the drugs is almost twice to those without the side effects. This finding is in line with previous reports of studies carried out in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, where side effects of TB drugs was one of the main reasons for non-adherence among TB patients [<xref rid="pone.0210422.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0210422.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The main limitation of this study was that the data were derived from studies that used different screening methods, the prevalence of non-adherence to anti TB medication could not be precisely determined. Second, all of the studies included in this review were cross-sectional in design; it neither represents seasonal variation of non-adherence outcomes nor establishes causal relationship. In addition, only articles published in English language were considered to include in this review. It should also be noted that some of the studies included in this review had a small sample size which could affect the estimated report.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this meta-analysis, studies revealed that the prevalence of non-adherence to anti-TB drugs among TB patients in Ethiopia was relatively high. Forgetfulness, fear of side effect of the drug, long waiting time in health institutions and feeling distance to health institution is long were significant determinants of non-adherence to anti-TB drugs. Therefore, based on our findings, we recommend that policies should be developed to strengthen the treatment management of TB patients. Where possible, decentralization of DOTs service to lower level of health facility structure should be prioritized.Moreover, side effects and other reasons which account for missing medication should be monitored early so that patients will adhere more to their medications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0210422.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>supplementary file search strategy.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0210422.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to all staffs of Debre Markos University of Medicine and Health Sciences who assisted us in this review.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DOT</term><def><p>Directly Observed Treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TB</term><def><p>Tuberculosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDR-TB</term><def><p>Multi Drug Resistance&#x02013;Tuberculosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0210422.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Organization WH.
