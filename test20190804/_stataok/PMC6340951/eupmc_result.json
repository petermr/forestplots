    "We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of probiotic combined with aminosalicylic on induction remission maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). We conducted systematic searches in several Chinese and English databases from inception to June 2018, screening randomized controlled trials about effect of probiotics combined with aminosalicylic acid on UC. The evaluation indicator was the rate of remission. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. A total of 27 studies with 1942 patients were included. The results indicated that the remission rate was significantly higher in the group using probiotics combined with aminosalicylic acid than that in the group using aminosalicylic acid alone (RR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.27-1.53, P=0.000). The subgroup analysis indicated that probiotics combined with aminosalicylic acid can significantly elevate the remission rate in both mild to moderate (RR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.16-1.54, P=0.000) and active stage (RR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.27-1.64, P=0.000) UC. In different number of bacterium, drug types and treatment periods, the combination with probiotics can significantly increase the remission rate UC. The funnel plot shows slight publication bias. Probiotics in conjunction with aminosalicylic can obviously increase the clinical remission rate of activity UC than drug alone. There was no significant difference between combined with mesalazine group and salicylazosulfapyridine group."
