  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We manually searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and Google databases from inception to June 2018. There was no language restriction for all of the publications. The search terms included key words and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms related to ““Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip”[Mesh]”; total hip arthroplasty; total hip replacement; THA, THR, direct anterior approach, DAA, posterior approach, and PA. The reference lists of included studies or meta-analysis were also manually examined for potential missing records. This meta-analysis did not involve direct contact with individual patients; therefore, no ethics approval was needed.</p>

  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the formulated search strategy, all papers were guided into Endnote X7 (Thompson Reuters, CA, USA). Two reviewers (Zhao Wang and Hong-wei Bao) independently scanned the titles and abstracts of the potential studies. If there was a controversy between the reviewers, we asked a senior reviewer to make a decision.</p>

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two reviewers (Zhao Wang and Jing-zhao Hou) independently extract the following information: first author name and publication year, country, patients’ general characteristic (no. of patients, age, proportion of female patients, BMI), outcomes, study, and follow-up duration. The primary outcomes were Harris hip score at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year, VAS at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h; incision length, operation time, postoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications (intraoperative fracture, postoperative dislocation, heterotopic ossification (HO), and groin pain)

  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Continuous outcomes (Harris hip score at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 1 year; VAS at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h; incision length, operation time, postoperative blood loss, and length of hospital stay) were expressed as the weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Complications (intraoperative fracture, postoperative dislocation, HO, and groin pain) were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs. 
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant difference. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software, version 12.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). To assess the heterogeneity, the 
   <span class="italic">I</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> index and corresponding 
   <span class="italic">p</span> value were calculated. When 
   <span class="italic">I</span>
   <span class="sup">2</span> was less than 50%, there was low heterogeneity; otherwise, there was a high heterogeneity. Publication bias was visually assessed using funnel plots (effect size was symmetry = no publication bias) and was quantitatively assessed using Begg’s test (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &gt; 0.05 = no publication bias).
