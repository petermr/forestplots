Liu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> conducted a meta-analysis about ADF and LAMP for OPLL. Several shortcomings were as follows:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>(1)</label><p>sample size may not be large enough to draw a definitive conclusion;</p></list-item><list-item><label>(2)</label><p>Grade evidence was not performed for the outcomes.</p></list-item></list><p>Wu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> comprehensively compared different surgical interventions for OPLL. Mixed comparison between ADF and LAMP has a significant selection bias.</p></sec><sec><label>4.3</label><title>Implications for clinical practice</title><p>First, we found that ADF group had higher postoperative JOA score and JOA recovery rate than LAMP group. This outcome indicated that ADF has a better neurological recovery and function than LAMP. The reason may LAMP relies heavily on the decompression effect for indirect decompression through a posterior shift of the spinal cord. Our result was in accordance with previous clinical study. Koda et al<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> revealed that LAMP should not be used for K-line (-) cervical OPLL and neurological recovery and function was not recover than pre-operation. We further analyzed preoperative JOA score of the ADF group and LAMP group. No significant difference was found between the 2 group. Thus, general characteristic of the included studies was comparable. Liu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> also revealed that ADF was associated was an increase of the JOA score than LAMP.</p><p>Then, we compared ADF and LAMP in terms of the cervical lordosis and late neurological deterioration. We found that ADF was associated with an increase of the cervical lordosis and decrease of the late neurologic deterioration than LAMP. Dynamic factors can affect clinical outcomes of ADF and LAMP. Thus, more studies should control clinical variable to identify the factors that affect clinical outcomes.</p><p>Another important finding in this meta-analysis was that we found ADF was associated with an increase of the operation time. Since ADF was a new surgical technique and thus need for time to learn. Qin et al<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> compared anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion versus posterior laminoplasty for the treatment of OPLL. Results showed that anterior cervical corpectomy was associated with an increase of the operation time than posterior laminoplasty. Previous meta-analyses did not include this important outcome. Thus, we when prepared administration ADF, operation time should be taken into consideration. There was no significant difference between the ADF and LAMP group in terms of the total blood loss. We then further analyzed the complication and reoperation rate between ADF and LAMP groups.</p></sec><sec><label>4.4</label><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A major strength of current meta-analysis was compliance with the PRISMA guidelines and assessed the evidence by Grade evidence. To increase the robustness of this meta-analysis, we applied sensitivity analysis for postoperative JOA score.</p><p>Our meta-analysis also had several limitations. First, the included patients have various clinical settings and general characteristic. Second, the operator experience was different and thus may cause potential bias. Third, no RCTs were included in this meta-analysis, and thus selection bias could not be ignored. Future large sample RCTs should be performed to further identify the optimal surgical method for OPLL.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our meta-analysis suggested that ADF was associated with better postoperative neurological function, neurological recovery rate, and less late neurological deterioration than LAMP in the treatment of OPLL. However, ADF was associated with an increase of the operation time than LAMP. No significant difference was found in blood loss, complication, re-operation rate. Future studies should be focused on long-term effects of ADF and LAMP.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p><bold>Conceptualization:</bold> Li-gang Qian, Kang Chen, Yu-min Chen.</p><p><bold>Data curation:</bold> Li-gang Qian, Zhi-xing Liang Liang, Yu-min Chen, Jie Meng.</p><p><bold>Formal analysis:</bold> Jie Meng.</p><p><bold>Investigation:</bold> Yun-fei Wang, Jie Meng.</p><p><bold>Methodology:</bold> Yun-fei Wang.</p><p><bold>Resources:</bold> Qing-gui Li.</p><p><bold>Software:</bold> Qing-gui Li, Bo Sun.</p><p><bold>Supervision:</bold> Tao-ping Chen, Jian-bao Jiao, Bo Sun.</p><p><bold>Validation:</bold> Jian-bao Jiao.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; original draft:</bold> Kang Chen, Yu-min Chen.</p><p><bold>Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing:</bold> Tao-ping Chen, Zhi-xing Liang Liang, Yu-min Chen.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ADF = anterior decompression and fusion, CI = confidence interval, JOA = Japanese orthopaedic association, LAMP = laminoplasty, NOS = Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale, OPLL = ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, RCTs = randomized controlled trials, RR = risk ratio, WMD = weighted mean difference.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>Tao-ping Chen and Li-gang Qian contributed equally to this article and should be listed as co-first author.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tani</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
