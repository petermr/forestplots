 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nine RCTs totaling 754 THAs (DAA group = 377, PA group = 377) met the criteria to be included in this meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis indicated that, compared with PA group, DAA group was associated with an increase of the Harris hip score at the 2-week and 4-week time points. No significant difference was found between DAA and PA groups of the Harris hip scores at 12 weeks, 1 year length of hospital stay (

  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.05). What is more, DAA was associated with a reduction of the incision length and postoperative blood loss (
