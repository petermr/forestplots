    "Rotator cuff tears are common and are associated with shoulder pain, disability, and dysfunction. Previous studies that have reported different arthroscopic techniques are controversial. A network meta-analysis with indirect and direct evidence was performed to compare the effectiveness of arthroscopic techniques for the treatment of rotator cuff tears. PUBMED, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE and Scopus were searched based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, and related studies that evaluated arthroscopic techniques for the treatment of rotator cuff tears were identified in May 2018. The primary outcome measure was the retear rate. The secondary outcome measures included the constant score and the range of motion (forward flexion and external rotation). Twenty-one trials comprising 1815 shoulders were included in the study. This study indicated that single-row (SR) repair resulted in a higher retear rate than suture bridge (SB) and double-row (DR) repairs. Moreover, the SR and DR repairs resulted in higher incidences of retear than SB repair. The ranking of the treatments based on the constant score and external rotation was SB repair, SR repair and DR repair, whereas the treatment ranking according to forward flexion was SB repair, DR repair and SR repair. In summary, this network meta-analysis provides evidence that SB repairs might be the best choice to improve the postoperative recovery of function and decrease the retear rate."
