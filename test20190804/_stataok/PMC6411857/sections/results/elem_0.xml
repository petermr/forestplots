   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3b</a>. Both the network meta-analysis and pairwise meta-analysis indicated that SR repair resulted in a higher retear rate than the SB [network: 0.40(0.19, 0.81); pairwise: 0.48(0.24, 0.95)] and DR [network: 0.61(0.37, 0.99); pairwise: 0.56(0.38, 0.80)] repairs. No significant difference was found between the DR and SB repairs with regard to the retear rate. Based on the SUCRA probability, SB repair had the lowest probability for retear (0.910), followed by DR repair (0.575) and SR repair (0.016).

  <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, the results based on the pairwise meta-analysis matched well with those based on the network meta-analysis. In this study, no inconsistencies for each outcome was found in the Dias model analysis (Table 
   <a rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" href="#Tab3">3</a>). The publication bias was only detected in the comparison of DR repair versus SR repair for the outcome of forward flexion (Table 
   <a rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" href="#Tab4">4</a>). This may be due to the number of studies included in this analysis was small. Fixed effects and random effects models were compared to detect the sensitivity. The results based on the fixed effects model (effective number of parameters [pD] = 14.96, deviance information criterion [DIC] = 48.88) were similar to those based on the random effects model (pD = 21.85 and DIC = 50.84).

  <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The network meta-analysis revealed hierarchies based on the primary (retear rate) and secondary outcomes (constant score, external rotation and forward flexion) for patients diagnosed with rotator cuff tears who underwent SR, SB and DR repair. The meta-analysis indicated the following: (1) SR repair resulted in a higher retear rate than DR and SB repairs; (2) the SR and DR repairs had higher incidences of retear than SB repair; (3) the ranking based on the constant score was SB repair, SR repair and DR repair; (4) the ranking for external rotation was SB repair, SR repair and DR repair; and (5) the ranking for forward flexion was SB repair, DR repair and SR repair.</p>
  <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are some advantages of this type of network meta-analysis: (1) a network meta-analysis provides greater accuracy than a conventional meta-analysis
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
   </span>; (2) the network meta-analysis provided indirect comparisons
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
   </span>, and SUCRA, which could improve the precision of even slight distinctions between SR, SB and DR repairs.
  </p>
  <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, this study also has some limitations. First, some low quality RCTs and case-control studies were included in this study, which may have reduced the significance of the conclusions. Second, the sample size was small, which reduced the accuracy. Third, some potential biases in the data, such as the size of rotator cuff tear, patient age and performance bias, could have affected the accuracy. Finally, some studies did not provide detailed information, such as the standard deviations; therefore, the inadequate data were replaced with statistical methods based on the provided data.</p>

   </span> previously performed a qualitative review without quantitative analysis to report that both DR repair and SB repair resulted in a lower retear rate than SR repair in most tear size categories, and differences in retear rates were found between DR and SB repair. Spiegl
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
   </span> summarized eight reviews of DR and SR repair and found a higher retear rate following SR repair than after DR repair. Sobhy
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>
   </span> also found that SR repair resulted in a higher radiological overall detected retear rate and radiological partial-thickness retear rate than DR repair. Moreover, Bedeir’s study
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>
   </span> suggested that DR and SB repair had a higher type 2 retear (medial cuff failure) rate than SR repair. Our network meta-analysis combined indirect and direct evidences to calculate the difference among multiple techniques for rotator cuff repair using quantitative method, which revealed that the DR and SB repairs resulted in lower retear rates than SR repair. Additionally, no statistically significant difference was found between the DR and SB repairs regarding the retear rate. Furthermore, the posterior probabilities and SUCRA were used to differentiate the slight distinctions among SB, DR and SR repair. In terms of achieving lower retear rates, the treatments were ranked as follows: SB repair, DR repair, and SR repair.

  <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The constant score includes shoulder function, range of motion, pain and strength and is used to assess shoulder therapies
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" href="#CR48">48</a>
   </span>. In a previous review
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
   </span>, no significant difference was found between SR repair and DR repair in terms of the constant score. No previous evidence-based study has analyzed the difference between SB repair and SR or DR repair. In this network meta-analysis, no significant difference was observed among SR repair, DR repair and SB repair in terms of the constant score. Based on the SUCRA, the treatments were ranked as SB repair, SR repair, and DR repair in terms of the achievement of higher constant scores.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The range of motion is critical for assessing the therapeutic value of these three arthroscopic methods. Prasathaporn
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
   </span> previously reported that DR repair provides greater external rotation but found no statistically significant difference in forward flexion. Xu
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" href="#CR49">49</a>
   </span> found no significant differences in external rotation or forward flexion. This network meta-analysis revealed no significant differences among SR repair, DR repair and SB repair in terms of external rotation or forward flexion. Moreover, SB repair provided a greater range of motion (external rotation and forward flexion) than SR and DR repair according to the SUCRA.
  </p>
  <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, this network meta-analysis provides evidence that SB repairs might be the best choice to improve the postoperative recovery of function and decrease the retear rate because of the greater tendon-bone contact area and the higher tendon-bone contact pressure.</p>
