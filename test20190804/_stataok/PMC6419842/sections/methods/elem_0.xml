All related studies on the efficacy and safety of SR repair, DR repair and SB repair based on the following search terms were collected: (rotator cuff tear) AND (therapy OR surgery OR treatment OR complications OR adverse effect) AND clinical trial; (Rotator Cuff Injuries/adverse effect [Mesh] OR Rotator Cuff Injuries/surgery [Mesh] OR Rotator Cuff Injuries/treatment [Mesh]) AND clinical trial[ptyp].</p>

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with fractures, secondary surgeries, dislocations and other diseases that affect the function of the shoulder; (2) interventions including conventional open or mini-open repair techniques; and (3) case reports.</p>

Additionally, the primary outcomes were the retear rate, constant score, external rotation and forward flexion. Two researchers extracted the above data independently, and disagreements were resolved by discussion.</p>

The pooled estimates of the odds ratios (ORs) or standardized mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the four outcomes (i.e., retear rate, constant score, external rotation and forward flexion) are presented

   </span>. Heterogeneity was assessed by chi-square tests and I-square tests. Significance values less than 0.10 for chi-square tests or more than 50% for I-square tests were interpreted as evidence of heterogeneity. Egger’s linear regression test were used for detectint the publication bias with Stata. Network meta-analyses using indirect and direct evidence based on a frequentist framework including network plot, forest plot and predictive interval plot were performed with Stata software (version 13.0). The codes, model and network graphs package used in this meta-analysis are free online
