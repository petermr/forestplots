    "BACKGROUND:To investigate whether the clinical effects of balance training were improved in hip fracture patients. METHODS:Electronic databases which included PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018 were searched. High-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective clinical controlled studies were selected based on inclusion criteria. Stata 12.0 was used for the meta-analysis. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess the effects. RESULTS:Finally, 9 studies with 872 patients (balance training = 445, control = 427) were included in our meta-analysis (published between 1997 and 2018). Compared with the control group, balance training group showed a significant increase in overall function (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI [0.25, 0.93], P = 0.001), gait speed (SMD = 0.63, 95% CI [0.19, 1.07], P = 0.005), lower limb strength (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI [0.50, 0.95], P = 0.000), activities of daily living (ADLs) (SMD = 0.97, 95% CI [0.61, 1.34], P = 0.000), performance task scores (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI [0.21, 0.61], P = 0.000), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) scores (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI [0.16, 0.47], P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS:Our meta-analysis revealed that the balance training group has improved overall physical functioning, gait, lower limb strength, performance task, and activity of daily living than the control group. More high-quality and large-scale RCTs are needed to identify the optimal regimen of balance training after hip fracture."
